# Shaun Eello, the Trickster

Created by JackRenoson, coded by Binbin.

A hero mod, introducing Shaun Eello, a Scout/Mage who utilizes tricks, books, cards, and drawing to great effect.

This currently does not include any events or quests related to Shaun. This will be updated in the future with a future mod release, it will include a sub-zone or three and a few quests. 

A couple of notes:
## Notes:
- This is currently a pre-release, so hasn't been fully play-tested or balanced at all. As such, I understand that things are going to be janky at times, and there are definitely bugs that will be worked out. Let me know if you come across any of them.
- **What to do if Shaun is not unlocked:** Due to some jankiness of the way the code works, Shaun is unlocked only for the profile that is open when you launch the game (and for new profiles). So if they aren't unlocked in the correct profile, switch to that profile, close the game and re-open it and they will be unlocked. I'll fix this in the future, but most people won't notice it. You can also just use the profile editor to fix it.
- I know that the Hero selection sprite for Shaun does not fit properly. I was too lazy to create custom sprites for this. I will fix it sometime soon.
- There are **no character events** for Shaun at this time. This is intentional as I am going to be releasing another mod in the next few months that will include loads of events for them along with some additional sub-zones.
- Shaun's selection location (in the Hero Selection screen) is intentionally far to the right. I have not yet automated the process of placing characters, and this is to accommodate Charls and a couple of heroes that I'm still working on. 
- I don't know how to add hinting to enchantments, so the tooltips in the Tome of Knowledge won't be fully updated. These will be updated one day.

This mod relies on [Obeliskial Content](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/meds/Obeliskial_Content/).
